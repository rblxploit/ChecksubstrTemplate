# Template for the checksubstr challenge
This is the template for the easy level challenge i made on the WRD forums.
This challenge is level easy.
It is inspired of some homework that my dad was explaining to a student.
What do do: Make a function that checks if a string is present in a substring

Where to work: the checksubstr function.<br>
It is a function that takes in argument str (the string) and substr (the substring to check how many times in the string)<br>
It has to return an integer which is how many times the substring is present in the string<br>
Return -2 if the substring is empty.

Rules
- Make it using this template. It has to be in C#. This code should work in .NET Framework, .NET Core or Mono
- It has to be your own code
- You should not rely heavily on some method already in C#. For example, do not use the substring method already included in C#

For me to verify, you have to send it. I will show all the codes from everybody when the limit date is finished.
It has to be the function only (checksubstr), not the rest of the code that i wrote. 
Do not give any executable file. Also, do not use obfuscation.
If you use some obfuscator or make your code hard to read by accident, without knowing it or by purpose, i will not even bother reading your code.

What you should try to do
- Make it as fast as possible
- Write it in beautiful code
- Make it easy to understand
- Search less things on the internet as possible. It is ok if you search for one thing but try to do it the least possible
- Last but not least, it has to work properly
